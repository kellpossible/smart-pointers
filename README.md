# Smart Pointers and Mutability Notes

This repository contains my notes following along with the video presentation [Crust of Rust: Smart Pointers and Interior Mutability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo) by Jon Gjengset. It explores how to implement simple versions of the standard library's `Cell`, `RefCell`, `Rc`, and how to make use of  `unsafe` code and the `UnsafeCell` to implement these lower level constructs and document it correctly.

**WARNING: this code should not be used in production!**
